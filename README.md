# Text-Summarization
Text Summarization Using T5 LLM
This project demonstrates the use of T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), a cutting-edge language model, for text summarization. T5 is pre-trained on diverse NLP tasks and excels at generating concise and meaningful summaries from large textual inputs.

### Features

Versatile Text-to-Text Framework: Treats summarization as a unified text generation task.
Prompt-Based Summarization: Uses intuitive prompts like summarize: to guide the model.
High-Quality Summaries: Generates coherent, context-aware summaries suitable for diverse applications.

## Workflow

### Input Text Preparation:

Input text is preprocessed and prefixed with the summarization prompt:
 summarize: [input text]  
Model Inference:

The prepared input is passed through the T5 model, which generates the summarized text.
Output Processing:

The generated summary is post-processed and returned as the final output.

### Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/t5-summarization 

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  

### Usage
Prepare your input text.
Run the summarization script:

python summarize.py --input "Your input text here"  

The output will be displayed or saved to a specified file.

### Dependencies
Python 3.x
Transformers Library (pip install transformers)
PyTorch or TensorFlow

### Future Enhancements
Fine-tuning T5 for domain-specific summarization tasks.
Incorporating evaluation metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU for summary quality assessment.
